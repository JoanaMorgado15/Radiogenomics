# Radiogenomics

Radiomic features from computed tomography (CT) scans have been used to create artificial intelligence- based models that predict gene mutation status for lung cancer characterization. In this study, we applied a comprehensive approach to assess the mutation status of EGFR, using radiomic features from the lung volume containing the nodule on CT images.
